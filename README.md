... has developed a tool for structural pile design which takes multiple GSA models and checks shear, axial and bending utilisation using Adsec. This allows complex loading to be set up in GSA and to have non-typical sections in Adsec. The tool enables rapid model iterations, while designing rebar at peak stress locations and determining the height at which you can reduce rebar down the piles. It has also proven useful for rapid extraction of max/min axials in the piles for geotechnical checks.
